The first edition started in 2017. The South African edition of Africa Communications Week has been running since 2018. Since then, Africa Communications Week has built bridges and has grown into the premier gathering for professionals passionate about the transformation of the continent through strategic communication. Narratives surrounding Africa have an impact on the socio-economic development of the continent, Africa focused communicators must, therefore, be strategic about shaping a narrative that is so vital to the transformation of the continent.
