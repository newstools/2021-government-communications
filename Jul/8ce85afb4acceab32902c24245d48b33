09 July 2021 The vaccination roll-out programme in the basic education sector has been extended to next week 14 July 2021. The extension became necessary when additional doses for basic education personnel became available. The extension will enable the sector to vaccinate more people but also to mop up where some sites experienced some technical challenges resulting in delays. According to the Department of Health 437,386 educators and staff have now been vaccinated in the sector since the roll-out began. The initial target was 582,564. The sector has also seen a strong demand for the vaccines in recent days. Provinces reported that more and more people were coming forward seeking to be vaccinated. More than 200, 000 more people have been added to the list of staff who will get vaccinated. The numbers will improve significantly today as Limpopo will vaccinate today as part of the plan to use Friday and Saturday to administer the vaccines on basic education personnel. A huge turn-out was reported today in various parts of Limpopo where educators and staff arrived to receive their single dose Johnson & Johnson vaccines. In order to address the challenges that have been experienced, the Department of Health has put in place the following measures to ensure that all eligible staff eventually get vaccinated; The Department urges all educators and staff to use the remaining period to get vaccinated.
