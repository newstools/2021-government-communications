23 February 2021 With 5 days to go before the closing date, South African media are invited to submit their entries for the 2021 SADC Media Awards competition. The Awards were established following a decision by the Council of Ministers in 1996 to establish a sector that deals with matters relating to amongst others, information, culture and sport. These awards serve as part of ensuring a link, coordination and synchronisation between formal structures of SADC governments, civil society, academia, labour and the media. To promote regional integration and cooperation (cross-border issues), the awards aim to recognise excellence in journalism in the area of print, photo, television, radio as well as to encourage media practitioners in member states to cover issues pertaining to the region. The forms and the 2021 competition rules can be found on the links below:Forms: https://www.gcis.gov.za/sites/default/files/SADC%20Entry%20form.pdfCompetition rules: https://www.gcis.gov.za/sites/default/files/SADC%202021%20Rules%20of%20C...
